title: Standing Desk Build
---

The goal is a desk that can take a hit from a car.

The problem is, the standing desk market is saturated.

I have had standing desks for approximately 9 years of my career now; all were nice, enterprise models that felt solid and provided a decent working surface. I wanted something nice for my home office, but everything that looked like it would be solid was at least $800+. This led to me doing a little research, and coming up with a rock solid desk for $308USD (not including accessories, like power strips).

I'm still writing this up now, but hope to have it all in here very soon!
